    <h1>Microsoft Internship</h1>
    <h3>Windows defender end-point protection for iOS</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      After reaching the hot and humid hyderabad city, the accomodation provided by microsoft was just right necessary.
      The first week of the internship was about Onboarding processes and talks. One of the interesting talks was by
       a couple of previous interns who became full time employees. They shared their intership experience and gave some tit-bits
       about the organisation and work. Microsoft takes a big step in inclusivity and accessibility as an organisation and
        I liked the principles and motto of Microsoft. The hyderabad center is called India development center(IDC) and we
        felt we are not away from IDC(Industrial design center).<br><br>

        <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;After choosing the project we met the teams and got to know
        about them. A group of interns are assigned under Foundry including us. Foundry is a space where microsoft tests their
        ambitious and innovative projects apart from other teams. Studio91 takes care of the design space that happens at microsoft
        research and innovation. So we were breifed about design work that happens at microsoft by Studio91 folks. Although it happened
        after few weeks, Studio91 had a different way of welcoming us. They invited us for the inspire event that happens where designers
        from different teams gather and share experiences. Few designers shared their design journey including their inception and the
        motivation behind the journey. One interesting thing was this briefing included more 'human' pictures in the slides.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;I choose a project which is creating actionable items for sales people on the field from the organisation. I chose this project
        because it involved challanges about voice & tone and also building an communication tool. (Certain things are information privacy protected)
        I'm not sharing the details of the problem area, But I'll be talking about my design process in the project. I met some of the sales people
        and used microsoft research also to conduct my secondary research. After getting the list of problems, with my previous experience of working
        on Adaptable cards & Microsoft Teams, I started making some initial prototypes. Adaptable cards have a prototyping tool which let's you immediately
        design and see the results and also allows a easier embedding in your Office 365 tools. Working out of Sketch & Figma was a beautiful experience.
        The designs were immediately taken to production.
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;During this first week of the Adaptable cards, I was not assigned with a design mentor but the Product managers and the developers helped me with
        everything. They even took me to a movie and I felt that was a nice break. During the second week I was assigned a design manager, Naveed Ahmed.
         To my shock, He's an IDC alumni and he was from the same interaction discipline in our school. I met naveed and he said these lines to me "Anjan, I feel the
         current project you are working on has less scope for you as a designer. let's put you on a different project". Then I was assigned to a new project
         where Microsoft is rolling out Windows Defender to iOS end-points.
         <br>
         <img src="Images/Timeline.png" alt="">
         &emsp;&emsp;The brief was straigtforward about the requirement of the product. The brief was to protect corporate owned iOS Devices and increase visibility
         to the security postures of these devices. Altough iOS devices are safe from applications and Insecure coding, there are various network threats
         that are vulnerable.I categorized threats based on the behavior types. The most possible threats like Phishing, Malware, ransomware are focused
         to be solved. I did a primary research with 7 users from different roles and organisations including designers, developers and business analysts.
         I also looked at other competitors trying to address the same problem and I did a secondary research on the pros and cons of each of these products.
         I then categorized my research insights into 5 different categories and gave a user quote for each of the insight. I then gave design recommendations
         for each of these problems.
         <br>
         &emsp;&emsp;Couple of the interesting examples I found out from my secondary research were Snapchat and Microsoft were once a victim of these threats and both
         the organisations could not do anything but write an apology to these users. My primiary research involved contextual enquiry with one of my previous
         colleauges also as they have moved to Microsoft difital workplace. I consolidated all the Qualitative analaysis and came up with various solutions.
         During the 5th week I was also working simultaneously on the Android version of the windows defender. I helped the android version with clear protoypes.
         <br>
         During my primary research following were the questions and goals for which I intended to find insights for:
       </p>
         <ul>
           <li>What does the information workers want to achieve with their mobile devices?</li>
           <li>What is the user’s mental model of network and security on mobile devices?</li>
           <li>What is the checklist of the security measures that the users follow?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>And my secondary research included several threat reports, cybernews, articles, other products:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Apple security</li>
           <li>Google security</li>
           <li>Verizon mobile security index report 2019</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
         <img src="Images/comp.png" alt="">
         &emsp;&emsp; The research helped me to find out intereseing problems and restructure the problem statement as: "How do we secure the network activity of
         employees on mobile devices and empower the organisations with safe Data & IT operations?". Then I started with looking at different design
         guidelines for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/" target="_blank" style="color:#3387f5;">iOS Devices,</a>
         <a href="https://material.io/design/guidelines-overview/" target="_blank" style="color:#3387f5;">Android Devices,</a>
         <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/" target="_blank" style="color:#3387f5;">Fluent design system</a>.
         The challenge lies in using these three different languages and coming up with a design language as Windows defender is a new type of product
         which lies outside of the fluent guideliens when it comes to mobiles.
         <br><br>
         Few of the interesting workshops that I attended during the internship inside microsoft are:
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>American Sign Language workshop about sensitisation</li>
         <li>Storytelling workshop by <a href="https://mario-juarez.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#3387f5;">Mario Juarez</a></li>
         <li>All hands painting session</li>
         <li>Experiences & Devices meetup</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
    Learnings & Takeaways:
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft research is very good and valuable. They have been researching with several products and their use cases. Their failure and success test data is useful for several other things. Because I’ve seen how valuable research wealth is for design I decided during the internship I’ll try and work on a research project in my P2 and P3.</li>
      <li>There’s this syndrome of designer supremacy that I carried during my first employment and I had the same moment again at my internship. The PM’s briefed me about the user personas and use cases and asked me to start designing screens for those. I was arguing with them about the user personas and how they have decided without a contextual enquiry but then I sat with the PM’s and saw how the user personas that they found were also sufficient for shipping the first version. These discussions helped me realise that PM’s have been seeing these users and the problem area for an year and how time is important in an agile setup.</li>
      <li>We had three design reviews with the design studio at the internship. This included sr.Des managers and product designers and the design heads. During my mid review my mentor told me “Anjan, you need to tell a better story”. Post that we had a storytelling workshop by a senior at Microsoft. He told us how the audience lose the interest with data on a screen and find it exciting when you narrate it. After my final review my manager told me my storytelling was better than the previous review. One of the happiest outcomes of the final review was the principal designer of Microsoft Edge asked me If I can present my deck to her team.</li>
      <li>One of the biggest challenge for me during my internship was writing a UX Research report. I was assigned the task of designing iOS and android screens. But, I wanted to investigate the other areas of vulnerabilities and threats by talking to the users. But my research insights needed to be documented well along with the design suggestions. I approached my design manager and told him that this has been a blocker for long time and he arranged a session with a researcher in the team. She taught me what are the important pointers in writing a research report. The biggest takeaway from that discussion was “Your report should be written in a way that data & cyber security should be understood by a 5 year old kid”. While I haven’t learnt how to write a report better I’m planning to do that this period at IDC.</li>
      <li>Microsoft as a organisation pushes everyone towards inclusivity and diversity. We had a one week intern learning session where they had a painting session and another session where they taught us the Accessibility sign language. During my internship I had access to Microsoft research and everyone in the organisation reached out to us personally if we have any blockers with subject matter or any knowledge. We had a sessions with the designers where they shared their design journey with us and we got to see how they experienced design as part of their profession. There were engineers and music enthusiasts who turned out as designers. Sessions like these inspired us for dreaming more. During this sessions also I met a lot of IDC alumni and we talked about professors at IDC. I personally felt the importance of IDC during the internship and I would try and utilise my time here at IDC this year to make most of it.</li>
      <li>After the internship I’m writing more notes in my mobile and I’m planning my work through reminders. This habit was the influence of the unorganised work that I had done during my initial stages of my internship and I intend to plan my work properly from this semester.</li>
      <li>During my internship I also decided to work more on how to convert research data into design ideas. I was also critically looking at fonts that Microsoft products use(Thanks to Dalvi sir’s course). After my PPO interview at my internship I wanted to think about what my immediate career position should be. Although I didn’t get the offer I started thinking about should I be a UX Designer or a Design researcher.</li>
      <li>One of the technical skills I picked up from the internship is Swift code development in Xcode. I’ve seen how to transform designs to screens and I developed few of the screens myself. I had UI sanity sessions with the engineering team and I realised how important is Adaptivity and Layout is important in UI Design.</li>
      <li>One of the important things that helped us with our internship is the connect with the mentors. We had 3 connects with the mentors where we define our core priorities for the internship and at every connect we defined what we could have done better for an better business impact and what my work has helped the team and what I intend to do in future. This helped us realise our goals for every period and helped us develop our performance along each period. Something like this at IDC with the professors would help us know what have we done till now and what we should do moving forward.</li>
    </ul>

      Few fun things we did:<br>
      During the second week we visited IKEA, Gyan and I cooked for few weeks at the accomidation, I personally had ordered 24 biryanis during my stay at Hyderabad.
