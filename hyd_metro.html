        <b style="width:50%;font-size:24px;">Summary</b><br><br>
Travelling by Metro rail is one of the fastest modes of Transportation within a city.
Major cities like Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi etc are employing Metro Rail
Transportation. Booking a ticket and travelling to a destination is the primary
concern of any passenger who enters the station. I wanted to address this concern by
improving the overall experience of the passenger.<br><br>
<b style="width:50%;font-size:24px;">Why</b><br><br>
Last month I travelled to Hyderabad where I had to take a Metro Train to reach
Habsiguda from JNTU College. At the JNTU station, I took a ticket to Habsiguda and
later I was asked to give Feedback about the system. These 2 processes made me
miss my train and wait for the next one. A mobile application which allows me to
book a ticket would have saved my time.<br><br>
<b style="width:50%;font-size:24px;">Challenges</b><br><br>
The process of getting a ticket from the counter at a station takes a lot of time.
Passengers do not have any guidance on where to interchange.
Iâ€™ve recorded only a few of the challenges for this version. New challenges will be
addressed in the next phase.<br><br>
<b style="width:50%;font-size:24px;">Goals & Objectives</b><br><br>
To book a ticket from a mobile app directly and save time.<br><br>
<b style="width:50%;font-size:24px;">Process</b><br><br>
I started by gathering the map details, station names and illustrated a mapped network
for the mobile application. After getting the details I started doing the wireframes.
The journey of ticket booking starts from the boarding station and selecting the
destination to book the ticket.<br><br>
The user journey of booking a ticket involves payment through a smart card or any
other available payment methods.<br><br>
The user can choose from either a rail map or a list of the stations available.<br><br>
<b style="width:50%;font-size:24px;">Solution</b><br><br>
I designed a flow for the above-mentioned goals which involves booking a ticket
from a mobile app.<br><br>
The following screens show the flow of ticket booking
