    <h1>Teaching unfamilair widgets to the visually impaired</h1>
    <h3>Masters Design Project</h3>

    <p>
      Mobile devices present a lot of widgets in our daily life for achieving respective interactions with the device.
      Widgets like scroll bar enables the interaction of scrolling between views via different interaction techniques.
      These widgets and interaction techniques are heavily designed for sighted users and then made accessible to the
      visually impaired. Sighted users easily understand how to use these novel user interfaces because of their visual
      affordances. However the interpretations of these novel interfaces that Screen readers provide to visually challenged
      users are not sufficient for them to form a conceptual model of the interface. This either prevents them from doing the
      tasks altogether or increases the amount of time these users spend to achieve tasks on such interfaces.<br><br>
